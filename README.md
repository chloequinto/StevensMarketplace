# Stevens Marketplace
CS546 Final Project

## Description 
The idea of this application is to allow users to post and sell used textbooks, furniture, subleasing apartments, etc. The value of the application is to give Stevens students a space to sell and buy items with each other. Currently, there are no applications tailored to Stevens students out there. 

## Installation 
To start, `git clone` and then `cd` into the project directory. 

Then you need to install and begin with: 
```bash 
npm install 
npm start 
```
