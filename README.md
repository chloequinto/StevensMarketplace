# StevensMarketplace
CS546 Final Project
The idea of this application is to allow users to post and sell used textbooks, furniture, subleasing apartments, etc. The value of the application is to give Stevens students a space to sell and buy items with each other. Currently, there are no applications tailored to Stevens students out there.
