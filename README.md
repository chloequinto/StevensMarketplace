# Stevens Marketplace
CS546 Final Project

## Description 
The idea of this application is to allow users to post and sell used textbooks, furniture, subleasing apartments, etc. The value of the application is to give Stevens students a space to sell and buy items with each other. Currently, there are no applications tailored to Stevens students out there. 

## Installation 
Install using npm: 
```bash 
npm install express-handlebars 
npm install express 
```
